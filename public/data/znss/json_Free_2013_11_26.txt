Although they may not have called themselves civil engineers, the designers and builders of ancient wonders like the Pyramids were undoubtedly people of extraordinary ingenuity and ability to solve problems. Throughout history, civilizations have depended on those who could figure out how to erect structures both modest and magnificent, to bring fresh water to large conglomerations of people and dispose of the wastes they generate, and to move people and goods safely and efficiently from one place to another.    These are the same basic challenges civil and environmental engineers face today. We have the same drive to find the best solutions to the most pressing problems of society. Over the years, the complexity and magnitude of many of the problems we address have changed. In response, so have our methods and materials. We now apply sophisticated technologies to meet society''s needs in an environmentally sustainable manner.   Here at Delaware, we''re proud of our department''s contributions to civil and environmental engineering practice, knowledge, and innovation. Training world-class engineers is our foremost objective. Our curriculum is currently undergoing a revision that will better prepare our graduates to meet 21st century challenges. Through problem-based classroom instruction, real-world internship experiences, and thought-provoking research opportunities, we provide a superior engineering education at all levels.    We recently established one of the most challenging undergraduate environmental engineering programs in the country. The program draws strength from our exceptional graduate program in this field, which has made major contributions over the years in such areas as toxic waste remediation, biological and chemical treatment of waste, and the interaction of soil and groundwater.    Our Center for Applied Coastal Research is one of the leading research institutions of its kind in the world, focusing on wave mechanics and interactions between the sea, shore, and structures in the coastal zone. We also have recently established two more centers that will facilitate cutting-edge research and technology transfer in their respective fields, the Center for Innovative Bridge Engineering and the Center for Metals in the Environment.    Structural and geotechnical engineers at Delaware have played a leading role in the application of advanced materials to bridge construction, infrastructure rehabilitation, and slope stabilization. They maintain a highly productive partnership with the College of Engineering''s renowned Center for Composite Materials. Our transportation specialists have developed a state-of-the-art Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) laboratory, and our railway engineering program is unique in the United States.    Overall, research funds coming to the department from agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, and the Federal Highway Administration increased almost fourfold during the 1990s. This has enabled us to expand the research opportunities available to both undergraduate and graduate students in the department.    We invite you to explore our web site further and to contact us with any questions you may have. Applications for admission (undergraduate and graduate), course descriptions, and maps and directions to the department are available on line, as well as directories for our faculty and staff. We encourage you to come and see for yourself the exciting educational opportunities we have to offer, either through one of the University of Delaware''s visitation weekends or a personally arranged tour.

It aims to increase public awareness of the importance of marine science and of the great diversity of work undertaken by marine scientists. In addition, AMSA strives to improve the public''s image of marine scientists and to forward their interests generally. AMSA promotes the discipline and provides information to the marine scientists of tomorrow through publication of the booklet Careers in Marine Science, now in its 5th edition. AMSA also plays an important role in commenting on marine issues and in debate of marine policy at state and national levels. The Association is represented on the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies (FASTS), which also plays an active role in developing science policy. AMSA has branches in every state, and the Australian Physical Oceanography Division is a formal division of the parent body.   While the majority of the membership are professional scientists and educators, AMSA actively encourages the involvement of students of marine science, both as student members and as participants in the Association''s activities. Through its annual scientific conference and quarterly Bulletin, AMSA facilitates liason and interaction among workers from a wide variety of disciplines in marine science in scattered institutions and centres. The Bulletin keeps members up-to-date with significant national and international news, happenings and issues in marine science, new book and journal publications, notices and updates of national and international conferences, and news of the state branches.'

At that time the laboratory was given the Scripps name in recognition of supporters Ellen Browning Scripps and E. W. Scripps.  Scripps staff numbers approximately 1,300, including about 90 faculty, nearly 300 other scientists, and some 200 graduate students. The institution''s annual expenditures total more than $140 million.  Research at Scripps encompasses physical, chemical, biological, geological, and geophysical studies of the oceans. Ongoing investigations include the topography and composition of the ocean bottom, waves and currents, and the flow and interchange of matter between seawater and the ocean bottom or the atmosphere. Scripps''s research ships are used in these investigations throughout the world''s oceans.  More than 300 programs may be under way at any time, including studies of air-sea interaction, climate prediction, earthquakes, the physiology of marine animals, marine chemistry, beach erosion, the marine food chain, the ecology of marine organisms, the geological history of the ocean basins, and the multidisciplinary aspects of global change and the environment.  Scripps operates a fleet of four ships and the platform FLIP for oceanographic research.

In 1928-29, a portion of the Coos Head Military Reservation was selected as the permanent site for the University''s marine program and in 1931 over 100 acres of the Reservation, including some Army Corps of Engineers buildings, was deeded to University of Oregon. These buildings became the first permanent classrooms, laboratories and dormitories. In 1937, the Oregon State System of Higher Education shifted stewardship of OIMB to Oregon State University (then Oregon State College) until the Second World War, when the site was reclaimed by the federal government for strategic purposes. After the war, OIMB was returned, first to Oregon State College, then in 1955 to the University of Oregon. Until the mid-1960''s, the facility served as a summer field station. In 1966, the University undertook a two-year program of extensive building repairs and began using the marine station as a permanent, year-round research facility. A few years later, year-round educational programs were added to the existing summer teaching program. These teaching programs, as well as the research mission, continue to the present day. In 1985, OIMB added new teaching laboratories, research facilities and dormitories with a major grant from the federal government. In 1999, OIMB celebrated the construction of two additional research laboratories as well as the Loyd and Dorothy Rippey Library.

Primarily engaged in basic research, EEMB researchers use their scientific understanding to address some of the worlds most pressing environmental issues including consequences of global warming, invasive and endangered species, impacts of environmental change, biological control of introduced pests and parasites, biodiversity, pollution, harmful algal blooms, and acid rain. Almost one hundred graduate students and dozens of post docs conduct research in the Department and over 1600 undergraduates are jointly instructed by faculty in EEMB and its sister department, Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB). EEMB administers four specialized undergraduate majors (Aquatic Biology, Ecology and Evolution, Physiology, and Zoology) and jointly oversees a general Biological Sciences major with MCDB. The undergraduate Aquatic/ Marine Biology Major has been ranked second in the nation and many undergraduates participate in original field and laboratory research with faculty. EEMB faculty are also known for their excellence in teaching. Two professors have received the campus'' Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Award in the Sciences and another has been recognized as the campus'' outstanding faculty mentor of undergraduate research.   The Department has been rated in the top 10 departments nationally for its overall research impact (Science Watch), and in the top 20 in ecology, evolution, and behavior (National Research Council). Distinctions earned by EEMB researchers include The Ecological Society of America''s Eminent Ecologist, Robert H. McArthur, and Mercer Awards, the Presidents Award from the American Society of Naturalists, the Bigelow Gold Medal in Oceanography, the Miescher-Ishida Prize, the Huffaker Medal in Population Biology, a Pew Fellow in Marine Conservation, and the Brewster Award in Ornithology. Five faculty are listed as among the most highly cited nationally (ISI) for the impact of their research and many have been elected as Fellows of national societies including the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Geophysical Union. EEMB faculty founded the NSF sponsored National Center for Ecosystems Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in Santa Barbara in 1995 and have directed NCEAS throughout its existence. Two NSF Long Term Ecological Research Sites, one in the Santa Barbara Channel and one in French Polynesia, are organized and implemented by faculty in the Department and faculty participate in 3 additional LTER sites in Alaska and Antarctica.   Located in an incomparably beautiful setting directly on the California coast, faculty and students in EEMB conduct research and teaching in a myriad of unique environments including the oceanic Pacific, deep coastal basins, estuarine, subtidal and intertidal marine coastal ecosystems near major faunal boundaries, and mountain, chaparral, oak woodland, desert, island, and coastal terrestrial and freshwater habitats. EEMB research studies are underway not only in California but across the globe including such regions as the south Pacific, the Sargasso Sea, Central and South America, the Arctic and Antarctica.

With initial professional appointments in physical, biological, chemical, geological, and meteorological oceanography, A&M''s program recognized from the beginning the inherent multidisciplinary nature of the field, including its important connection with the atmosphere. Operations began in September of that year, with a curriculum leading to graduate degrees in oceanography.   Partly as a result of growing interest in the earth sciences, a new College of Geosciences was created in July of 1964, bringing together independent Departments of Oceanography and Meteorology with Departments of Geology, Geography, and Geophysics under one administrative unit. At the time, the Oceanography Department housed about ten faculty and 75 graduate students, and a marine laboratory was maintained in Galveston. The original 'meteorological' subdiscipline of oceanography has since evolved into coupled ocean-atmosphere studies and climate research.   As a broader response to expansion and growth, the name of the institution was changed in 1963 to Texas A&M University, and the first steps were taken to establish coeducation in place of the formerly all-male student body with compulsory military training. As a result of these farsighted changes, Texas A&M today is a multi-faceted university with a student body numbering approximately 42,000, of whom about half are women.   The department''s growth continued throughout the 1960''s and into the 1970''s during the 'golden age of oceanography,' when both public interest and federal funding increased apace. In the early 1970''s, Texas A&M was named a Sea Grant University, beginning an era of issues-oriented ocean studies that continues today. Growth of the faculty and student populations brought pressure for increased space to accommodate them, leading to the construction of a 15-story building that has housed three departments of the College of Geosciences. The 'Oceanography and Meteorology' building (officially the David G. Eller Building) provides office and laboratory space on the main campus for administration, scientists, students, and staff.   Presently, the Oceanography Department includes about three dozen faculty, four dozen research scientists and staff, and about 100 graduate students divided among the four principal subdisciplines of physical, chemical, biological, and geological/geophysical oceanography. In 1971, students from each of the four sections of the department founded the Oceanography Graduate Council (OGC), whose purpose is to enhance the academic and social welfare of all oceanography graduate students at Texas A&M. The OGC continues its active and successful program, and its members play an important role in determining student-related aspects of departmental functions.   The seventies also produced a new research ship built by the U.S. Navy specifically for multi-disciplinary oceanographic research. The Research Vessel Gyre (AGOR-21), now a 182-foot vessel with an 8,000 mile cruising range, began operations for the Oceanography Department in January, 1974, operating from its home port located in Galveston. The vessel has cruised in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. With ongoing improvements in instrumentation and equipment, R/V Gyre continues along seagoing tradition in the department and provides a capable at-sea platform for scientists, researchers, and students at Texas A&M and many other cooperating institutions. In 1994, when the Gyre began its 20th year of operations, the title to this research vessel transferred from the Navy to TAMU.  In 1984, Texas A&M University was named as the site of the international program, the Ocean Drilling Project. Facilities includea separate building and the 471-foot drill ship, JOIDES (Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling) Resolution, which is capable of drilling bottom cores in the deep ocean in ice-free waters. In 1992, the Board of Regents merged the Galveston campus into the re-named College of Geosciences and Maritime Studies. The Department of Oceanography in College Station administratively merged with the Department of Marine Sciences in Galveston. By 1996 Galveston became a branch campus of Texas A&M University and the College again became the College of Geosciences. The Department of Oceanography completed an administrative de-merger in 2001, and the Department of Marine Sciences was re-established, but the two departments on the two campuses continue to work together. The graduate program is headquartered in College Station and the undergraduate degree program is operated from Galveston.  Work in oceanography allows one to participate in the exciting study to understand a large part of our planet. Achieving such understanding has become even more important as our society extends its ability to affect the marine environment from localized coastal situations to the entire globe. Oceanographic understanding will allow us to handle our environmental stewardship more wisely in the coming years.

Our vantage point, at the tip of Cape Cod, allows us to work in the midst of an extraordinary ecosystem where all things converge. It is the place where the temperate zone and the sub-boreal zone meet, where the sandy shore knows its northernmost reach and the rocky shore is about to begin. The explosion of upwelling nutrients just offshore and the convergence of many habitats means an explosion of wildlife as well, a home to feed and breed for shorebirds and turtles, whales and dolphins, seals and ground fish, sponges and periwinkles, sea urchins and sand dollars.   From our field station in Provincetown on this narrow, sandy spit of land, we can easily voyage into the greater Gulf of Maine to work on issues of habitat protection, ecosystem management, marine mammal and marine wildlife conservation. We fly aerial surveys over Cape Cod Bay; survey the humpback feeding grounds of Jeffreys Ledge off New Hampshire and Stellwagen Bank off Massachusetts; huddle over countless tables with shipping companies, municipal leaders, fishermen, and government officials to come up with new ways of solving old problems.  Our work caries us to collaborations throughout the Gulf of Maine with such institutions as the U.S. Coast Guard, McMaster University, the New England Aquarium, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. We welcome them back to our Provincetown port as well, where scientists and managers, professors and policy makers can use our facilities in pursuit of a common goal: the preservation of marine habitats.  We believe the preservation of marine and coastal habitats and the recovery of species is crucial to the health of all life. But to care deeply about a world that we do not inhabit, about microscopic diatoms and plankton, about fiddler crabs and baleen whales whose lives are seemingly independent of our own, it is first necessary to know about them. It is this desire to know which drives our work, for we believe that the successful management and preservation of ecosystems depends on strong, detailed knowledge of species and their natural history.  At the heart of our mission is conservation biology, what sociobiologist E.O. Wilson calls 揳 discipline with a deadline,?for what we do not save today may be gone tomorrow.   The mission of CCS is:  昑o conduct scientific research with emphasis on marine mammals of the western North Atlantic and on the coastal and marine habitats and resources of the Gulf of Maine;   ?To promote stewardship of coastal and marine ecosystems; and  ?To conduct educational activities and to provide educational resources that encourage the responsible use and conservation of coastal and marine ecosystems.

GeoRef is the most comprehensive database in the geosciences and continues to grow by more than 80,000 references a year (82,000 in 2002). The database contains over 2.4 million references to geoscience journal articles, books, maps, conference papers, reports and theses. You can gain access to this vast amount of information through searching on the worldwide web, online, in the GeoRef CD, or in the printed BIBLIOGRAPHY AND INDEX OF GEOLOGY.   A database search produces a customized bibliography. Within seconds, the computer reports the number of references found on a given topic. You can then specify which references you want to see and how much information you want about each.   The GeoRef database covers the geology of North America from 1785 to the present and the geology of the rest of the world from 1933 to the present. The database includes references to all publications of the U.S. Geological Survey. Masters'' theses and doctoral dissertations from U.S. and Canadian universities are also covered.   To maintain the database, GeoRef editor/indexers regularly scan more than 3,500 journals in 40 languages as well as new books, maps, and reports. They record the bibliographic data for each document and assign index terms to describe it. Each month between 4,000 and 7,000 new references are added to the database and also printed in the BIBLIOGRAPHY AND INDEX OF GEOLOGY.   The American Geological Institute, owner and producer of GeoRef, licenses the database to distributors and user organizations.

In 1993, NCHGR expanded its role on the NIH campus by establishing the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) to apply genome technologies to the study of specific diseases. In 1996, the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) was also established (co-funded by eight NIH institutes and centers) to study the genetic components of complex disorders.  In 1997 the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) renamed NCHGR the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), officially elevating it to the status of research institute - one of 27 institutes and centers that make up the NIH.  Now, with the human genome sequence complete since April 2003, scientists around the world have access to a database that greatly facilitates and accelerates the pace of biomedical research.

The Society has over 600 members in 2003, drawn from across Australia and overseas, representing the government, research, educational and private sectors.  Annual conference Annual Conferences have been held once every year since the Society''s inception. They are now the highlight of the Society''s calendar, providing a forum for members around Australia to meet and discuss their work. Since the first conference conducted by the Society in its own right, at Port Stephens in 1975, succeeding conferences have continued to be conducted most successfully, and in a relatively informal atmosphere despite consistent growth in both attendances and programs.  Workshops To enhance its contribution to research, conservation and management of fish and their habitats in Australia, the Society decided to organise and hold workshops on specific topics in conjunction with it''s annual conferences. The first such workshop, a two-day event on Australian Threatened Fishes, was held at the Arthur Rylah Institute, Melbourne, immediately prior to the Society''s 1985 annual conference.  In addition to these major workshops, another series of workshops on fish collection management, organised independently by museum-affiliated members but held under the auspices of the Society, was initiated with a one-day program immediately after the 1985 Melbourne conference. Workshop topics have included the following:  Legal sizes and their use in fisheries management  Taking Stock: defining and managing shared resources  Sustainable Fisheries Through Sustainable Habitat  Fish Movement and Migration In some years the Society has also hosted international conferences in place of the workshop (e.g. International Larval Fish Conference at Sydney in 1995 and the World Congress on Aquatic Protected Areas at Cairns in 2002).  Newsletter The Society publishes a newsletter twice a year, which contains information of interest to the Society membership, including notices and information on Society activities and a bibliography of publications by Society members. The newsletter is available through the Members section of this site. The proceedings of Society-held workshops are usually produced separately as special publications, often with the assistance of other government and non-government organisations.

The coastal ocean is the focus of increasing research for reasons relating to both short-term anthropogenic impacts and long-term global change. Fundamental questions about coastal ocean physics need to be answered if human impact and global change are to be assessed appropriately.   Housed in Crittenton Hall, the CCPO is located six blocks east of campus on an attractive waterfront site surrounded by stately live oaks. The Center provides office and laboratory facilities for 13 full-time faculty and their complement of research associates, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and support staff. Oceanographic observing systems include CTDs, current meters, and ADCPs. The Center has an agreement with NOAA/NOS that facilitates the interchange of local environmental data. The Center has a state-of-the-art computer system based on Sun, SGI, and PC X61/Windows/Linux workstations. Advanced computational and visualization software is provided. A full-time computer systems engineer maintains the system and provides support for CCPO researchers.   Through funding which allows faculty, visitors, students, consultants, and research associates to focus their efforts on specific research areas, CCPO supports and facilitates innovative research on the physical oceanography of the coastal ocean and other coastal related processes. Research supported by the Center includes particle trajectory analysis, large-scale along-shore flow, modeling cross-shelf transport mechanisms, effects of buoyancy forcing, and description of coastal ocean systems.
